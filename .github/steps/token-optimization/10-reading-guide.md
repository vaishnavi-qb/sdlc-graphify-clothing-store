## Step 10: Add the reading guide

_Setup is done — save the rest as one short reference doc._ :sparkles:

**Goal:** Put model selection, prompt habits, and a light monitoring checklist in **one** document to read later.

**Why it matters:** These are habits, not more config files. One guide is enough.

### :keyboard: Activity: Add `docs/TOKEN_OPTIMIZATION.md`

1. **Create the folder and file:**

```bash
mkdir -p docs
```

2. **Create `docs/TOKEN_OPTIMIZATION.md`** and paste:

```markdown
# Token optimization guide (clothing store)

Use this as a quick reference. Steps 8–9 already set up `.aiignore` and assistant rules.

## 1) Model selection
Default cheap. Escalate only when needed.

| Task | Tier |
|------|------|
| Autocomplete / tiny edits | Haiku-class / fast tier |
| Boilerplate, CRUD, renames | Haiku / Flash-class |
| Daily multi-file feature work | Sonnet-class (workhorse) |
| Hard debugging, auth/payment architecture | Opus-class / frontier |

Rule: Start cheap. If stuck after one focused attempt, escalate and say why.

## 2) Efficient prompts
Order every prompt (helps caching):
1. Stable: project rules / conventions (same every turn)
2. Semi-stable: module names by reference — not paste
3. Volatile: today's ask last

Template:
STABLE:
- Diffs only; no whole-file paste
- Stack: ecommerce-backend + ecommerce-frontend

TASK (volatile):
- <one concrete ask>

Prompt patterns:
- Show only the changed lines for this fix. Do not rewrite entire files.
- Using paymentController by name (do not paste whole files), explain in max 10 bullets.

## 3) Weekly checklist
- [ ] Spot-check 3 chats: were whole files pasted?
- [ ] Did CRUD/rename work stay on a cheap tier?
- [ ] Any chat > 20 messages that should have been reset?
- [ ] `.aiignore` still excludes node_modules and dist?
- [ ] Note one expensive failure (e.g. payment debug) and whether escalate was justified
```

3. **Self-check:** file mentions cheap/default (or Haiku), escalate (or frontier), `stable` + `volatile`, `Show only the changed`, `paymentController`, and `checklist` or `Weekly`.

4. **Commit and push:**

```bash
git add docs/TOKEN_OPTIMIZATION.md
git commit -m "Add token optimization reading guide"
git push
```

5. **Wait about 20 seconds** for the course review comment.
